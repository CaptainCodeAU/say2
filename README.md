# say2

`say2` is a set of tools to access the high-quality Siri speech models programmatically on your Mac. You can access it three ways: a CLI, an OpenAI-compatible HTTP API, and a Swift SDK. It reaches neural Siri voices that Apple's public speech APIs exclude and can write WAV, CAF, or raw PCM; stream audio; and return native word timings.

```console
$ say2 voices
NAME    LANGUAGE  VERSION  ENGINE  INSTALLED  ASSET KEY
Aaron   en-US     5030     siri    yes        en-US:natural:male:Aaron:premium:5030

$ say2 -v Aaron -o hello.wav "The good voice, from the terminal."
✓ Aaron · 2.91s · 48000 Hz · /path/to/hello.wav
```

## Requirements

- macOS 15.6 or newer
- Apple silicon
- Xcode 26 or newer
- At least one Siri voice installed by macOS

Currently verified on macOS 26.6.2 (25G83); older releases are expected to work but have not been runtime-verified.

## Command-line users

The CLI is the recommended starting point for people, scripts, and non-Swift applications.

### Install with Homebrew

```sh
brew tap CaptainCodeAU/say2 https://github.com/CaptainCodeAU/say2.git
brew install CaptainCodeAU/say2/say2
```

Open a new terminal and verify the installation with:

```sh
say2 doctor
say2 voices
```

### Render a file

```sh
# Generate "Hello." in Aaron's voice and save it as speech.wav
say2 synthesize --voice Aaron --language en-US -o speech.wav "Hello."
# Generate the text currently in the clipboard as article.wav
pbpaste | say2 synthesize -o article.wav
# Generate the text of chapter.txt and save it as chapter.caf
say2 -f chapter.txt --format caf -o chapter.caf
```

WAV is the default file format. Raw PCM is signed little-endian 16-bit audio; Siri currently returns 48 kHz mono.

### Use it like `say`

The common `say` surface is accepted, so existing scripts can often change only the command name:

```sh
alias say=say2
say2 -v Aaron -r 210 -o faster.wav "Two hundred ten words per minute."
```

`-v`, `-o`, `-f`, `-r`, `--file-format`, `--data-format`, `--quality`, and `--progress` are supported. As with `say`, `-r` means words per minute; 175 WPM maps to the native `--rate 1.0`. `--rate` itself remains a multiplier. Lossless PCM has no encoder-quality setting, so valid `--quality` values are accepted only for command compatibility. Unsupported flags fail clearly instead of being ignored.

### Stream audio

```sh
say2 synthesize --format pcm -o - "Audio starts before the sentence is finished." \
  | your-audio-consumer
```

### Word timings

```sh
say2 synthesize \
  --voice Aaron \
  --timings timings.json \
  --json \
  -o narration.wav \
  "Highlight these words as they are spoken."
```

The daemon supplies each word's start time and an `NSRange` into the source text. The JSON therefore identifies offsets as UTF-16, which keeps emoji, CJK, and other non-BMP text correct. End times are explicitly marked `endDerived: true`: they are derived from the next word's start, and the final word ends at the measured audio duration. If a voice does not support native timings, the tool returns an empty list and `timingsSupported: false`.

### Discover and install voices

```sh
say2 voices
say2 voices --json
say2 voices --include-av
say2 voices --available
say2 voices --install "Siri Voice Name"
say2 voices --install "Siri Voice Name" --wait
say2 voices --purge "Siri Voice Name"
say2 voices --status "Siri Voice Name"
say2 voices --manage
```

- --available lists downloadable premium Siri voices from Apple’s TTS catalog. If the catalog is unavailable, JSON is labeled installed-fallback and only installed voices are returned.
- --install adds a subscription to a voice.
- --wait polls until both the local UAF bundle and daemon voice exist; a timeout does not cancel the request.
- --status reports the current install status of a voice.
- --purge deletes the selected voice’s local asset. It does not change voice subscriptions, so macOS may download the voice again if an app or system service still subscribes to it.

## OpenAI-compatible HTTP API

Start the local HTTP API server with:

```sh
say2 serve --port 8080
```

It implements:

- `GET /v1/models` — installed voices
- `POST /v1/audio/speech` — `model`, `input`, `voice`, `response_format`, and `speed`

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/audio/speech \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "input": "A local neural voice.",
    "voice": "Aaron",
    "response_format": "wav",
    "speed": 1.0
  }' \
  --output speech.wav
```

`wav` and `pcm` are the supported response formats.

## Diagnostics

```sh
say2 doctor
say2 doctor --json
```

The report includes the macOS product version and build, architecture, framework and daemon status, engine availability, installed voice assets, ANE compilation state, observed audio format, and a short real non-silent synthesis probe. `doctor --json` is the right attachment for a compatibility report.

## Complete CLI reference

This section documents every command, option, alias, accepted value, default, and combination rule currently implemented by the CLI. Option names are case-sensitive; values such as engine and format names are case-insensitive where noted.

### `synthesize`

```text
say2 synthesize [OPTIONS] [TEXT...]
say2 [OPTIONS] TEXT...
echo TEXT | say2 synthesize [OPTIONS]
```

Positional text, `-f`/`--input-file`, and standard input are the three input modes. `--` ends option parsing so text beginning with a hyphen can be spoken. Long synthesis options that take a value also accept `--option=value` as an alternative to `--option value`; the other commands require the separated form.

| Option                         | Accepted value and default                                       | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-v NAME`, `--voice NAME`      | Display name or asset identifier; default: engine-selected voice | Select the voice case-insensitively. A catalog identifier is mapped to its installed version when possible. Without an explicit voice, Siri uses its first matching installed voice; AV uses the platform default for the requested language, or `en-US` when no language is given. |
| `-l TAG`, `--language TAG`     | Language tag such as `en-US`; default: no restriction            | Restrict voice selection to an exact, case-insensitive language match.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Cannot be combined with positional text.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `-r WPM`                       | Greater than 0 through 700; default: 175                         | `say`-compatible words per minute. The CLI maps 175 WPM to native rate `1.0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `--rate MULTIPLIER`            | Greater than 0 through 4; default: `1.0`                         | Set the native speaking-rate multiplier directly. If both rate forms are supplied, the last one wins.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `--pitch MULTIPLIER`           | `0.5` through `2.0`; default: `1.0`                              | Set native pitch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Output rules:

- With no `-o`/`--output`, synthesis is rendered to a temporary WAV file, played through the default audio device, and then removed.
- `-o -` requires `--format pcm`. The engine must resolve to `siri` or `av`; omitting `--engine` uses the default `siri`, while `auto` is rejected because fallback after partial streaming could mix engines.
- When PCM owns standard output, audio bytes go to standard output and JSON, progress, warnings, and errors go to standard error.
- `auto` falls back only for daemon, engine, or audio failures. A missing requested voice and other permanent errors do not silently fall back.
- Long input is split at natural boundaries into bounded sequential renders. Each piece must preserve the same audio format, voice, and selected engine.
- WAV has an approximately 4 GB container limit. Use raw PCM for larger output.

### `voices`

| Option              | Accepted value and default                                                 | Behavior                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--json`            | No value                                                                   | Emit the selected voice operation as JSON instead of the human-readable table or status.                                                                           |

| `--wait`            | No value                                                                   | With `--install`, poll installed inventory until the voice appears or the wait times out. This does not expose fabricated percentage progress.                     |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | `1` through `3600`; default: `300` for install waiting and `10` for status | Bound `--install --wait` polling or the `--status` inventory request. With `--install`, `--timeout` requires `--wait`.                                             |
| `--manage`          | No value                                                                   | Open Accessibility → Read & Speak in System Settings for macOS-managed voice removal.                                                                              |

`--install`, `--status`, and `--manage` are mutually exclusive actions. None can be combined with `--available` or `--include-av`. `--wait` requires `--install`; `--timeout` requires either `--status` or `--install --wait`. `--available` and `--include-av` may be combined when listing.

### `doctor`

```text
say2 doctor [--json] [--skip-probe]
```

| Option         | Default | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--json`       | Off     | Emit the complete doctor report as JSON.                                                                                                                                       |
| `--skip-probe` | Off     | Skip only the real audio synthesis probe. Framework, daemon, engine, installed-voice, and ANE compilation checks still run. A skipped probe leaves compatibility `unverified`. |
| `-h`, `--help` | —       | Print doctor help and exit successfully.                                                                                                                                       |

Without `--skip-probe`, doctor synthesizes unique text with Siri when reachable and otherwise uses AV, then validates that the result is non-silent and structurally plausible. A failed probe is recorded in the report; it does not make the `doctor` command itself exit unsuccessfully.

### `serve`

```text
say2 serve [--host ADDRESS] [--port NUMBER] [--engine KIND] [--verbose] [--allow-remote]
```

| Option           | Accepted value and default                                 | Behavior                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--host ADDRESS` | IPv4 or IPv6 literal, or `localhost`; default: `127.0.0.1` | Select the bind address. A non-loopback address requires `--allow-remote`; without it, `serve` refuses to start. IPv6 addresses are displayed in brackets. |
| `--port NUMBER`  | `1` through `65535`; default: `8080`                       | Select the listening port.                                                                                                                        |
| `--engine KIND`  | `siri`, `av`, or `auto`; default: `siri`                   | Select the engine used for both model listing and synthesis. Values are case-insensitive.                                                         |
| `--verbose`      | Off                                                        | Log every request failure to standard error, not only unexpected internal ones, in addition to returning the JSON HTTP error response.            |
| `--allow-remote` | Off                                                        | Confirm that binding a non-loopback `--host` is intentional. Required for any address other than `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, or `localhost`.              |
| `-h`, `--help`   | —                                                          | Print server help and exit successfully.                                                                                                          |

The server handles one synthesis request at a time and always prints its listening URL to standard error. It has no authentication or TLS, so `serve` refuses to bind a non-loopback address unless `--allow-remote` is passed explicitly; anyone who can reach the port then has unauthenticated use of the endpoint. Errors from unexpected internal failures are returned to callers as a generic `Internal server error` message (the real detail is always logged to standard error); errors that are part of the documented API — bad input, missing voice, engine unavailable — are still returned with their specific message.

`GET /v1/models` returns an OpenAI-style model list. Each installed voice is represented as a model with `id`, `object: "model"`, and `owned_by: "local-macos"`. The selected server engine controls whether the list comes from Siri, AV, or Siri-with-AV-fallback.

`POST /v1/audio/speech` requires `Content-Type: application/json` and these fields:

| JSON field        | Required | Accepted value and default                                                                               |
| ----------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `model`           | Yes      | String accepted for OpenAI request compatibility; engine selection comes from `say2 serve --engine`. |
| `input`           | Yes      | Non-whitespace text.                                                                                     |
| `voice`           | Yes      | Voice display name or asset identifier.                                                                  |
| `response_format` | No       | `wav` or `pcm`; default: `wav`.                                                                          |
| `speed`           | No       | `0.25` through `4.0`; default: `1.0`.                                                                    |

A successful speech response is `audio/wav` or `application/octet-stream` and carries `X-Say2-Engine: siri|av`. Errors use `{"error":{"message":"..."}}` with an appropriate HTTP status. Unknown routes return `404`.

### JSON and timing payloads

CLI JSON is pretty-printed with sorted keys. The principal payloads are:

| Command                               | JSON payload                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `synthesize --json`                   | `schemaVersion`, selected `engine`, optional `fallbackFrom`, `voice`, `audio`, `timings`, `timingsSupported`, `elapsedSeconds`, and optional `timeToFirstAudioSeconds`. `voice` contains `name`, `language`, `assetKey`, `version`, `engine`, and `installed`. `audio` contains `format`, `output`, sample format, byte/sample counts, duration, and `nonSilent`. |
| `synthesize --timings PATH`           | `schemaVersion`, `sourceRangeEncoding: "utf16"`, `endTimes: "derived"`, and `timings`. Each timing contains `text`, `start`, derived `end`, `utf16Location`, `utf16Length`, and `endDerived`.                                                                                                                                                                     |

Most versioned CLI payloads currently use `schemaVersion: 1`. The installation result returned by `voices --status --json` and `voices --install --wait --json` is the explicit unversioned exception. JSON normally goes to standard output; during raw PCM streaming, synthesis JSON goes to standard error so the audio stream remains clean.

## Swift SDK

`Say2Client` is the supported Swift SDK for listing voices and requesting WAV or PCM audio from a separately running `say2` helper. The application imports a standard Swift package; the helper process owns the private macOS framework and can fail or restart without taking the host app down.

```text
Your Swift app → Say2Client → localhost → say2 serve → macOS voice service
```

### Add the package

In Xcode, add this repository as a package dependency and select the `Say2Client` product. The equivalent `Package.swift` entry is:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(
        url: "https://github.com/CaptainCodeAU/say2.git",
        from: "1.0.0"
    ),
]
```

Then add `.product(name: "Say2Client", package: "say2")` to the application target. The SDK is intentionally independent of `Say2Core`, so a consuming app does not need Apple's private Swift interface in its build.

### Start and configure the helper

Install the CLI on the same Mac, then start its loopback-only server:

```sh
say2 serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080
```

The SDK connects to that address by default. A different helper port can be configured explicitly:

```swift
import Foundation
import Say2Client

let client = Say2Client(configuration: .init(
    baseURL: URL(string: "http://127.0.0.1:9090")!
))
```

`Say2Client` connects to an existing local helper. The host application starts and supervises the `say2 serve` process.

### List voices and synthesize speech

```swift
import Foundation
import Say2Client

let client = Say2Client()
let voices = try await client.voices()

let audio = try await client.synthesize(.init(
    text: "A local neural voice from a Swift app.",
    voice: voices.first?.id ?? "Aaron",
    format: .wav,
    speed: 1.0
))

try audio.data.write(
    to: URL(fileURLWithPath: "speech.wav"),
    options: .atomic
)
```

For long articles or books, save the response directly to a file so the complete audio does not have to fit in the app's memory:

```swift
let output = URL(fileURLWithPath: "book.wav")
let audioFile = try await client.synthesize(.init(
    text: bookText,
    voice: voices.first?.id ?? "Aaron"
), to: output)
```

The helper breaks long input into manageable pieces and writes each piece to disk as it finishes. Input length is therefore limited by available time and disk space, rather than by a fixed text-size cutoff. WAV itself has a roughly 4 GB file-size ceiling; use raw PCM for output beyond that format limit.

The response reports whether the helper used the `siri` or public `av` engine. Server errors, including a missing voice or unavailable engine, arrive as typed Swift errors.

## Exit codes

The interface version is `1.0.0`. It covers the documented CLI behavior and HTTP routes used by the Swift SDK. Most versioned CLI JSON payloads carry `schemaVersion: 1`; the installation-status payload exception is documented in [JSON and timing payloads](#json-and-timing-payloads). Stable CLI exit codes:

| Code | Meaning                                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Success                                                          |
| 2    | Invalid invocation                                               |
| 3    | No compatible engine                                             |
| 4    | Voice not found                                                  |
| 5    | Daemon or engine unreachable                                     |
| 6    | Empty, silent, malformed, or implausibly short audio             |
| 7    | Timed out waiting for a requested operation to become observable |
| 70   | Unexpected internal failure                                      |
| 130  | Cancelled                                                        |

## Testing and performance

```sh
make test       # unit tests plus a clean external Swift-client package build
make smoke      # real installed Siri voice, WAV, timing, and doctor checks
make live-test  # Siri, AV, Unicode timing, and HTTP integration tests
make benchmark  # time-to-first-audio and total-time CSV
```

The unit suite covers CLI validation and `say` translation, WAV headers, silence and frame validation, HTTP parsing and OpenAI request shapes, and UTF-16 timing ranges. Live tests use unique text and validate actual speech rather than treating a build or file write as proof. No test fuzzes Apple's daemon.
